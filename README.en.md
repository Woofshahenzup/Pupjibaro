Pupjibaro is a remaster of the official version of PuppyLinux retro-precise-5.7.1 
that was intended in users with modest equipment (256-1) Giga of ram and with little knowledge 
on linux, so it has a number of assistants and applications that make it 
easier to use, translated in a 95% spanish( we keep continue in translate process ) 
The remastering was done by two known users in the puppy spanish universe as developers
other major versions in Spanish, josejp2424 and nilsonmorales, one Salvadoran and other 
Argentine, made society and created this remaster with some 
variants of the original detailed below.

### The Jíbaro dog

This species belongs to the Maroons mammals, introduced in Cuba during 
Spanish colonization. 

The domestic dog becomes Jíbaro once 
leave the houses and into the woods.

When they were into the woods, changed their character and habits, and evolved 
a new breed wild, pronounced in his descendants.

Hence the codename for the version of PuppyLinux Pupjibaro.
